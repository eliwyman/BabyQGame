learned to compile whilst including other java classes in the same directory,
you must:

a) include "package <parent directory>" in each .java file
	and then compile using "javac <parent>/*.java"

or:

b) make sure you don't include the "package" and compile from the same directory

Classes could be more split up:

BabyQ for interface

BabyGame control and logic

BabySprite/board objects

BabyShip?

BabyBoard?

BabyCell
